Food Nutrients Analysis Using Power BI Dashboard

Overview

A Power BI dashboard for food nutrients analysis helps visualize and analyze the nutritional content of various food items. It enables users to track macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and other essential dietary factors. This is useful for nutritionists, dietitians, fitness enthusiasts, and food industry professionals.
